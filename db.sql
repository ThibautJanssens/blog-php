Since the 19th century, it has spread from its origins to other cultures where it is commonly practiced in private and business life.</p><p>Meditation may be used with the aim of reducing stress, anxiety, depression, and pain, and increasing peace, perception, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-concept">self-concept</a>, and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Well-being">well-being</a>.

In the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sahaja_Yoga#Sahaja_meditation_and_associated_research">meditation practice of the Sahaja yoga spiritual movement</a>, the focus is on thoughts ceasing. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luminosity_(Vajrayana)">Clear light yoga</a> also aims at a state of no mental content, as does the no thought (wu nian) state taught by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Huineng#No-thought_and_meditation">Huineng</a>, and the teaching of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yaoshan_Weiyan">Yaoshan Weiyan</a>.</p><h3>Automatic self-transcending</h3><p>One proposal is that <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transcendental_meditation">transcendental meditation</a> and possibly other techniques be grouped as an ''automatic self-transcending'' set of techniques.</p><h3>Other typologies</h3><p>Other typologies include dividing meditation into concentrative, generative, receptive and reflective practices.</p><h3>Meditation methods used by some well-known meditators</h3><ul><li>Multiple methods; <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pema_Ch%C3%B6dr%C3%B6n">Pema Chödrön</a> (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shambhala_Training#Meditation_technique">shambhala</a> – uses multiple methods), <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Susan_Piver">Susan Piver</a> (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shambhala_Training#Meditation_technique">shambhala</a>), <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/S.N.Goenka">S.N.Goenka</a> (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vipassan%C4%81#Vipassanā_meditation">vipassana</a> – uses multiple methods), <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_Goldstein_(writer)">Joseph Goldstein</a> (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vipassan%C4%81#Vipassanā_meditation">vipassana</a>), Judson Brewer (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vipassan%C4%81#Vipassanā_meditation">vipassana</a>), <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yuval_Harari">Yuval Harari</a> (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vipassan%C4%81#Vipassanā_meditation">vipassana</a>), <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/14th_Dalai_Lama">14th Dalai Lama</a> (various, including analytic meditation), <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matthieu_Ricard">Matthieu Ricard</a> (loving-kindness, open awareness, analytic), <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sharon_Salzberg">Sharon Salzberg</a> (loving-kindness, mindfulness, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vipassan%C4%81#Vipassanā_meditation">vipassana</a>), <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daniel_Goleman">Daniel Goleman</a> (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dzogchen#Meditative_practices">dzogchen</a>, other), <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thubten_Chodron">Thubten Chodron</a> (stabilizing, analytical, loving-kindness), <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martine_Batchelor">Martine</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stephen_Batchelor_(author)">Stephen Batchelor</a> (mindfulness breath, body, sounds, feeling tones (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vedan%C4%81">vedanas</a>), Seon questioning, appreciative joy (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mudita">mudita</a>)).</li><li>Open awareness; <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jon_Kabat-Zinn">Jon Kabat-Zinn</a> (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mindfulness">mindfulness</a>), <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sam_Harris">Sam Harris</a> (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mindfulness">mindfulness</a>).</li><li>Chakra Meditation; Michal Levin</li></ul><h2>Meditation practice</h2><h3>Common practice timings</h3><p>The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transcendental_meditation_technique">transcendental meditation technique</a> recommends practice of 20 minutes twice per day.

Most prayer beads and Christian <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rosary_based_prayers">rosaries</a> consist of pearls or beads linked together by a thread. The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rosary">Roman Catholic rosary</a> is a string of beads containing five sets with ten small beads. The Hindu <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japa_mala">japa mala</a> has 108 beads (the figure 108 in itself having spiritual significance, as well as those used in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jainism">Jainism</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buddhist_prayer_beads">Buddhist prayer beads</a>.

(2,	'Narcissistic personality disorder',	'<p><strong>Narcissistic personality disorder</strong> (<strong>NPD</strong>) is a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personality_disorder">personality disorder</a> with a long-term pattern of abnormal behavior characterized by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grandiosity">exaggerated feelings of self-importance</a>, excessive need for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Admiration">admiration</a>, and a lack of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Empathy">empathy</a>. Those affected often spend much time thinking about achieving <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abusive_power_and_control">power</a> or success, or on their <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vanity">appearance</a>. They often take advantage of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interpersonal_relationships">people around them</a>. The behavior typically begins by early adulthood, and occurs across a variety of social situations.</p><p>The cause of narcissistic personality disorder is unknown. It is a personality disorder classified within <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cluster_B_personality_disorders">cluster B</a> by the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnostic_and_Statistical_Manual_of_Mental_Disorders"><i>Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</i></a> (DSM). Diagnosis is made by a healthcare professional interviewing the person in question. The condition needs to be differentiated from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mania">mania</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Substance_use_disorder">substance use disorder</a>.</p><p>Treatments have not been well studied. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychotherapy">Therapy</a> is often difficult, as people with the disorder frequently do not consider themselves to have a problem. About one percent of people are believed to be affected at some point in their life. It appears to occur more often in males than females and affects young people more than older people. The personality was first described in 1925 by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Waelder">Robert Waelder</a>, and the term NPD came into use in 1968.</p><h2>Signs and symptoms</h2><p>People with narcissistic personality disorder (NPD) are characterized by persistent <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grandiosity">grandiosity</a>, excessive need for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Admiration">admiration</a>, and a personal disdain and lack of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Empathy">empathy</a> for others. As such, the person with NPD usually displays arrogance and a distorted sense of superiority, and they seek to establish <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abusive_power_and_control">abusive power and control</a> over others. Self-confidence (a strong sense of self) is different from narcissistic personality disorder; people with NPD typically value themselves over others to the extent that they openly disregard the feelings and wishes of others, and expect to be treated as superior, regardless of their actual status or achievements. Moreover, the person with narcissistic personality disorder usually exhibits a fragile ego (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-concept">self-concept</a>), intolerance of criticism, and a tendency to belittle others in order to validate their own superiority.</p><p>The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DSM-5">DSM-5</a> indicates that persons with NPD usually display some or all of the following symptoms, typically without the commensurate qualities or accomplishments:</p><ol><li>Grandiosity with expectations of superior treatment from other people</li><li>Fixation on fantasies of power, success, intelligence, attractiveness, etc.</li><li>Self-perception of being unique, superior, and associated with high-status people and institutions</li><li>Need for continual admiration from others</li><li>Sense of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entitlement">entitlement</a> to special treatment and to obedience from others</li><li>Exploitation of others to achieve personal gain</li><li>Unwillingness to empathize with the feelings, wishes, and needs of other people</li><li>Intense envy of others, and the belief that others are equally envious of them</li><li>Pompous and arrogant demeanor</li></ol><p>Narcissistic personality disorder usually develops in adolescence or early adulthood. It is not uncommon for children and adolescents to display traits similar to those of NPD, but such occurrences are usually transient, and below the criteria for a diagnosis of NPD. True symptoms of NPD are pervasive, apparent in varied situations, and rigid, remaining consistent over time. The NPD symptoms must be sufficiently severe that they significantly impair the person''s capabilities to develop meaningful human relationships. Generally, the symptoms of NPD also impair the person''s psychological abilities to function, either at work, or school, or important social settings. The DSM-5 indicates that the traits manifested by the person must substantially differ from cultural norms, in order to qualify as symptoms of NPD.</p><h3>Associated features</h3><p>People with NPD tend to exaggerate their skills, accomplishments, and their level of intimacy with people they consider high-status. This sense of superiority may cause them to monopolize conversations or to become impatient or disdainful when others talk about themselves. When their own ego is wounded by a real or perceived criticism, their anger can be disproportionate to the situation, but typically, their actions and responses are deliberate and calculated. Despite occasional flare-ups of insecurity, their self-image is primarily stable (i.e., overinflated).</p><p>To the extent that people are pathologically narcissistic, they can be <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Control_freak">controlling</a>, blaming, self-absorbed, intolerant of others'' views, unaware of others'' needs and the effects of their behavior on others, and insist that others see them as they wish to be seen. Narcissistic individuals use various strategies to protect the self at the expense of others. They tend to devalue, derogate, insult, and blame others, and they often respond to threatening feedback with anger and hostility. Since the fragile ego of individuals with NPD is hypersensitive to perceived criticism or defeat, they are prone to feelings of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shame">shame</a>, humiliation, and worthlessness over minor or even imagined incidents. They usually mask these feelings from others with feigned humility or by isolating themselves socially, or they may react with outbursts of rage, defiance, or by seeking revenge. The merging of the "inflated self-concept" and the "actual self" is seen in the inherent grandiosity of narcissistic personality disorder. Also inherent in this process are the defense mechanisms of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denial">denial</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Idealization_and_devaluation">idealization and devaluation</a>.</p><p>According to the DSM-5: "Many highly successful individuals display personality traits that might be considered narcissistic. Only when these traits are inflexible, maladaptive, and persisting and cause significant functional impairment or subjective distress do they constitute narcissistic personality disorder." Due to the high-functionality associated with narcissism, some people may not view it as an impairment in their lives. Although overconfidence tends to make individuals with NPD ambitious, it does not necessarily lead to success and high achievement professionally. These individuals may be unwilling to compete or may refuse to take any risks in order to avoid appearing like a failure. In addition, their inability to tolerate setbacks, disagreements, or criticism, along with lack of empathy, make it difficult for such individuals to work cooperatively with others or to maintain long-term professional relationships with superiors and colleagues.</p><h2>Causes</h2><p>The causes of narcissistic personality disorder are unknown. Experts tend to apply a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biopsychosocial_model">biopsychosocial model</a> of causation, meaning that a combination of environmental, social, genetic and neurobiological factors are likely to play a role in formulating a narcissistic personality.</p><h3>Genetic</h3><p>There is evidence that narcissistic personality disorder is heritable, and individuals are much more likely to develop NPD if they have a family history of the disorder. Studies on the occurrence of personality disorders in twins determined that there is a moderate to high <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heritability">heritability</a> for narcissistic personality disorder.</p><p>However, the specific <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genes">genes</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epistasis">gene interactions</a> that contribute to its cause—and how they may influence the developmental and physiological processes underlying this condition—have yet to be determined.</p><h3>Environment</h3><p>Environmental and social factors are also thought to have a significant influence on the onset of NPD. In some people, pathological narcissism may develop from an impaired <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attachment_theory">attachment</a> to their primary caregivers, usually their parents. This can result in the child''s perception of himself/herself as unimportant and unconnected to others. The child typically comes to believe they have some personality defect that makes them unvalued and unwanted. Overindulgent, permissive parenting as well as insensitive, over-controlling parenting, are believed to be contributing factors.</p><p>According to Leonard Groopman and Arnold Cooper, the following have been identified by various researchers as possible factors that promote the development of NPD:</p><ul><li>An oversensitive <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Temperament">temperament</a> (personality traits) at birth.</li><li>Excessive admiration that is never balanced with realistic feedback.</li><li>Excessive <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Praise">praise</a> for good behaviors or excessive <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Criticism">criticism</a> for bad behaviors in childhood.</li><li>Overindulgence and overvaluation by parents, other family members, or peers.</li><li>Being praised for perceived exceptional looks or abilities by adults.</li><li>Severe <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emotional_abuse">emotional abuse</a> in childhood.</li><li>Unpredictable or unreliable caregiving from parents.</li><li>Learning <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychological_manipulation">manipulative</a> behaviors from parents or peers.</li><li>Valued by parents as a means to regulate their own <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-esteem">self-esteem</a>.</li></ul><p>Cultural elements are believed to influence the prevalence of NPD as well since NPD traits have been found to be more common in modern societies than in traditional ones.</p><h2>Pathophysiology</h2><p>There is little research into the neurological underpinnings of narcissistic personality disorder. However, recent research has identified a structural abnormality in the brains of those with narcissistic personality disorder, specifically noting less volume of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gray_matter">gray matter</a> in the left anterior <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insular_cortex">insula</a>. Another study has associated the condition with reduced gray matter in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prefrontal_cortex">prefrontal cortex</a>.</p><p>The brain regions identified in the above studies are associated with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Empathy">empathy</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compassion">compassion</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emotional_regulation">emotional regulation</a>, and cognitive functioning. These findings suggest that narcissistic personality disorder is related to a compromised capacity for emotional empathy and emotional regulation.</p><h2>Diagnosis</h2><h3>DSM-5</h3><p>The formulation of narcissistic personality disorder in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Psychiatric_Association">American Psychiatric Association</a>''s (APA) <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DSM-IV-TR"><i>Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</i>, 4th Edition, Text Revision</a> (DSM-IV-TR) was criticised for failing to describe the range and complexity of the disorder. Critics said it focuses overly on "the narcissistic individual''s external, symptomatic, or social interpersonal patterns—at the expense of ... internal complexity and individual suffering", which they argued reduced its clinical utility.</p><p>The Personality and Personality Disorders Work Group originally proposed the elimination of NPD as a distinct disorder in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DSM-5">DSM-5</a> as part of a major revamping of the diagnostic criteria for personality disorders, replacing a categorical with a dimensional approach based on the severity of dysfunctional personality trait domains. Some clinicians objected to this, characterizing the new diagnostic system as an "unwieldy conglomeration of disparate models that cannot happily coexist" and may have limited usefulness in clinical practice. The general move towards a dimensional (personality trait-based) view of the Personality Disorders has been maintained despite the reintroduction of NPD.</p><h3>ICD-10</h3><p>The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Health_Organization">World Health Organization</a>''s (WHO) <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ICD-10"><i>International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems</i>, 10th Edition</a> (ICD-10) lists narcissistic personality disorder under o<i>ther specific personality disorders</i>. It is a requirement of ICD-10 that a diagnosis of any specific personality disorder also satisfies a set of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personality_disorder#General_diagnostic_criteria_2">general personality disorder criteria.</a></p>',	'2019-03-15 08:54:07.561',	2);
